Adapted from: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/soy-and-ginger-steamed-fish

## Ingredients:

- 4 (6 oz) skinless white fish fillets (such as cod, flounder, sea bass, or halibut)
- 1 oz piece ginger, peeled
- 2 scallions
- 2 tsp low-sodium soy sauce
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp neutral oil
- 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 4 Thai chiles, thinly sliced (optional)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 1/3 cup sake or dry white wine
- 4 (3 x 3 in) pieces napa cabbage leaves
- 4 (3 x 3 in) pieces kombu (optional)

## Instructions:

1. Cut the ginger and scallions into thin matchsticks. In a small bowl, toss half of each with 2 tsp soy sauce, sesame oil, and 2 tbsp neutral oil. Set aside for serving.

2. Mix chopped garlic, sliced chiles, sugar, 1/3 cup soy sauce, and sake (or wine) in another bowl. Keep this steaming sauce nearby.

3. Season fish lightly with salt. Let it sit for about 10 minutes, then gently pat dry. Place one napa cabbage square (and one kombu square if using) on each fish fillet.

4. Fill a pot with about 1 inch of water and bring to a simmer. Arrange fish in a steamer basket and steam until opaque and just cooked through, about 8-10 minutes.

5. Heat the remaining 1/4 cup neutral oil in a small pan over medium-high until shimmering. Transfer fish to serving bowls, spoon over the garlic-soy steaming sauce, top with the reserved ginger-scallion mixture, and carefully drizzle the hot oil over each portion.
