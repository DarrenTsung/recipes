# Recipes

A personal collection of recipes, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Local Development

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Adding a Recipe

Add a new Markdown file to `_recipes/` (use `snake_case` filenames). Each recipe needs at minimum a `title` in the front matter:

```markdown
---
title: Recipe Name
---
```
