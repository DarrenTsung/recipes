Bắp Cải Xào Tỏi

## Ingredients:

- 2 tablespoons neutral oil
- ½ head green cabbage, chopped into 2-inch pieces
- 6 cloves garlic, smashed
- 2 Thai peppers (optional)
- Ginger (optional, charred with cabbage)
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- ¼ teaspoon white pepper

## Instructions:

1. **Heat Pan:**
   - Heat a wok or wide-surface pan over high heat for 2 to 3 minutes until hot but not smoking.

2. **Char Cabbage:**
   - Add the oil and swirl around to coat the bottom of the pan.
   - Add all of the cabbage (and optional ginger) and let it sit undisturbed for 1 to 2 minutes to char.

3. **Add Aromatics:**
   - Add in the garlic and Thai peppers (if using) and toss together.

4. **Finish:**
   - Add in fish sauce and white pepper and toss together until well incorporated.
   - Cook for a few more minutes, or until well charred and crisp/tender in texture.

## Notes:

- Use Taiwanese cabbage if available - it's flatter, less dense, sweeter, and cooks through more quickly.
- Pan should be screaming hot so the cabbage chars when you set it down.
